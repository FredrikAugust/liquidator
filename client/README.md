# Liquidator frontend

You can run this project in development mode with `npm start`, and you can build a new release with `npm build`. To run the (as of yet) non-existant tests, enter `npm test`.

## Notes

For developing with styled-components, I recommend using the `vscode-styled-components`-extension, as it gives you syntax highlighting when writing the css.
